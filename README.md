This is a Inventory Management system mini project.

Working of the program :-

First when the program runs it will ask you to enter your item name, No. of items And initial price of item.

After this system will ask you for adding no.of item and new price if there is any change otherwise you can enter zero. You can also remove NO. of your item if you wish otherwise you can enter zero.

The code will not run properly if you try to remove No. of items without adding any No. of item in the system first.

So make sure to add the item first and then either remove or display the new price and updated No. of items.

At last system will display item name, updated price and updated No. of item.
